CUSTOM Slider /-***********************-*---------------------********************** */

////////// 1 /////////////////////////////

Sure, I can help you with that. Here's a basic example of how you can implement a swipe feature using plain JavaScript. This example will allow you to swipe with the mouse as well as with the mouse scroll.

```javascript
let startX;
let scrollLeft;
let isDown = false;
const slider = document.querySelector('.items');

slider.addEventListener('mousedown', (e) => {
  isDown = true;
  slider.classList.add('active');
  startX = e.pageX - slider.offsetLeft;
  scrollLeft = slider.scrollLeft;
});

slider.addEventListener('mouseleave', () => {
  isDown = false;
  slider.classList.remove('active');
});

slider.addEventListener('mouseup', () => {
  isDown = false;
  slider.classList.remove('active');
});

slider.addEventListener('mousemove', (e) => {
  if(!isDown) return;
  e.preventDefault();
  const x = e.pageX - slider.offsetLeft;
  const walk = (x - startX) * 3; //scroll-fast
  slider.scrollLeft = scrollLeft - walk;
});

// Mouse scroll event
slider.addEventListener('wheel', function(e) {
  e.preventDefault();
  slider.scrollLeft += e.deltaY;
});
```

In this code, we're adding several event listeners to the slider:
- `mousedown`: This event fires when the mouse button is pressed down. We record the initial X position and the scroll position.
- `mouseleave` and `mouseup`: These events fire when the mouse button is released or leaves the slider. We use these to stop the swiping action.
- `mousemove`: This event fires when the mouse moves. If the mouse is down, we calculate the new scroll position and update it.
- `wheel`: This event fires when the mouse wheel is scrolled. We use it to scroll the slider.

Please replace '.items' with your own class or id. Also, don't forget to style your slider and its items with CSS. For example, you might want to set `overflow-x: scroll` and `white-space: nowrap` on the slider, and `display: inline-block` on the items.

Remember, this is a basic example and might not cover all edge cases. You might need to adjust it according to your needs. If you're developing a large application, consider using or creating a library to handle touch gestures in a more robust way. Good luck with your project! 😊

First, let’s create a new component called CustomSwiper. This component will render its children inside a div that we’ll attach the swipe events to.

import React, { useRef, useState } from 'react';

const CustomSwiper = ({ children }) => {
  const sliderRef = useRef();
  const [isDown, setIsDown] = useState(false);
  const [startX, setStartX] = useState(0);
  const [scrollLeft, setScrollLeft] = useState(0);

  const handleMouseDown = (e) => {
    setIsDown(true);
    setStartX(e.pageX - sliderRef.current.offsetLeft);
    setScrollLeft(sliderRef.current.scrollLeft);
  };

  const handleMouseLeave = () => {
    setIsDown(false);
  };

  const handleMouseUp = () => {
    setIsDown(false);
  };

  const handleMouseMove = (e) => {
    if (!isDown) return;
    e.preventDefault();
    const x = e.pageX - sliderRef.current.offsetLeft;
    const walk = (x - startX) * 3; // scroll-fast
    sliderRef.current.scrollLeft = scrollLeft - walk;
  };

  const handleWheel = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    sliderRef.current.scrollLeft += e.deltaY;
  };

  return (
    <div
      ref={sliderRef}
      onMouseDown={handleMouseDown}
      onMouseLeave={handleMouseLeave}
      onMouseUp={handleMouseUp}
      onMouseMove={handleMouseMove}
      onWheel={handleWheel}
    >
      {children}
    </div>
  );
};

export default CustomSwiper;


<CustomSwiper>
  <SwiperSlide></SwiperSlide>
  <SwiperSlide></SwiperSlide>
  {/* ... */}
</CustomSwiper>

I apologize for the confusion. The `<SwiperSlide>` component is part of the `react-swiper` library, which you mentioned you don't want to use. 

Instead, you can create your own custom "slide" component. Here's a simple example of how you can do this:

```jsx
const Slide = ({ children }) => (
  <div style={{ display: 'inline-block', width: '200px', height: '100px', margin: '10px' }}>
    {children}
  </div>
);
```

You can use this `Slide` component in your app like this:

```jsx
<CustomSwiper>
  <Slide>Slide 1</Slide>
  <Slide>Slide 2</Slide>
  {/* ... */}
</CustomSwiper>
```

Each `Slide` will be an individual item that you can swipe through. You can customize the `Slide` component according to your needs, for example by adjusting the width, height, and margin, or adding more complex content.

Remember, this is a basic example and might not cover all edge cases. You might need to adjust it according to your needs. If you're developing a large application, consider using or creating a library to handle touch gestures in a more robust way. Good luck with your project! 





//////////* ************************ **********////////////////

 The CustomSwiper and Slide components I provided will create a slider that you can scroll through using the mouse wheel or by clicking and dragging with the mouse. The mousedown, mousemove, and mouseup events handle the click-and-drag functionality, while the wheel event handles the mouse scroll functionality.

Remember, this is a basic example and might not cover all edge cases. You might need to adjust it according to your needs. If you’re developing a large application, consider using or creating a library to handle touch gestures in a more robust way.
